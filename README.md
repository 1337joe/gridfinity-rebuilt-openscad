# gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad

A ground-up rebuild of the stock gridfinity bins in OpenSCAD. Started because of a couple slight imperfections and inconsistencies in the Fusion360 parametric bins. Open to feedback, because I could not feasibly test all combinations of bins, so some of them may have issues. I tried my best to exactly match the original gridfinity dimensions, but some of the geometry is slightly incorrect. For instance, the tab angle is 32 degrees instead of 36 degrees, as it made construction easier. The fillets may also be slightly incorrect. However, I think they are negligible differences. The script is also fairly laggy, and will probably take at leaste a minute to render a bin. 

Things this script can do: 
- any size of bin (width, length, height)
- any number of compartments (along BOTH x and y axis)
- togglable scoop
- togglable holes
- supportless printing hole structures
- togglable tabs
- split tabs and tab alignment
